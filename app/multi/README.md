Multi-threshhold app
=====================

More complex application examples, based on thesholds and/or priority.

- Controller: uses upper/lower threshold + priority
- Controller_1: uses a fixed threshold + priority
- Controller_2: same as _1, uses a slightly different logic

The deployment models are to install the app/s in various configurations. 
The tag '-mn' in the '.depl' model name indicates a mininet configuration.
The number in the same name indicates how many nodes are used/switches controlled.
